    <h4>As you can see, this fundraising opportunity
can be a great benefit to your organization!
Above is just an example. You can custom tailor your program
 to fit the needs of your organization.</h4>
            <br>
            <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Day of Delivery</h2>
            <h3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">What you can expect!</h3> 
            <h4>PAYMENT</h4>
            <p>Company policy requires our drivers to collect payment before they offload your order. Please be ready
with your preferred method of payment. We accept the following: Organizational check, money order,
cashier’s check or if you have made prior arrangements with our office, a purchase order # or voucher #. We
cannot accept personal checks, starter checks or large amounts of cash. We appreciate your cooperation with
this transaction.</p>
            <h4>ACCOUNTING</h4>
            <p>Once we get the payment out of the way we will then present you with a full computer generated accounting
book of your sale. It will then compile the totals for the entire group. Each individual’s order will be
alphabetized and assigned a number. This number will correspond to the number you will see on the box
packed with the completed order.</p>
            <h4>STAGING</h4>
            <p>Please allow sufficient time and adequate space for the driver to stage your order. Time and space
considerations can greatly influence your overall satisfaction with the entire delivery process. A simple
guideline would be to schedule your delivery 15-20 minutes before your announced pickup time for groups of
20 or less and as much as 90 minutes for large groups (larger groups please consult with our office for help in
your time calculations). Adequate space goes a long way to making your delivery and setup as smooth as
possible. Remember, we never turn down volunteer help. The more volunteer help you have will directly affect
how smooth the overall success of the fundraiser.
Your orders will be boxed according to seller and staged in numerical order. When your sellers arrive please
have them check and confirm their orders before they leave the staging area. Any discrepancies should be
reported to the chairperson at this time. You, as the chairperson, must report those to our office for correction
on the next business day. Boxes will include a number, a name, the number of boxes required to complete
the order, a packing list and an organizational identification. Make sure everyone picks up the right
number of boxes!</p>
             <h4>FINAL REMINDERS</h4>
            <p>Product is frozen! Please adjust your allowable pickup times when external conditions dictate
(summer)! Please provide our office with a cell phone # or phone # where you can be reached
at time of delivery . Our driver may need directions or may need to let you know of any
complications (traffic). We are very proud of the service we provide you and are continually
trying to improve it. We hope your fund raising efforts have been $ucce$$ful and enjoyable
and we hope to have you back soon!!!</p>
